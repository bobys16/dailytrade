# Copy Trading Platform

Welcome to the Copy Trading Platform project repository! This platform allows users to engage in copy trading, where they can follow and copy trades made by experienced traders, manage their trading accounts, and interact with the community.

## Features

1. **Trading Accounts**: Users are provided with high and low-risk trading accounts upon registration. These accounts are automatically generated and tailored to suit different risk preferences.

2. **Trading View**: The platform offers a comprehensive trading view that allows users to monitor market trends, analyze charts, and make informed trading decisions.

3. **Copy Trade**: Users can choose to follow experienced traders, known as masters, and automatically replicate their trades in real-time.

4. **Wallet**: Users have a centralized wallet where they can add funds and manage their balances. They can transfer funds between their main balance and different trading accounts (low or high risk).

5. **Support Ticket**: A support ticket system is available for users to submit queries, report issues, or seek assistance from the support team.

6. **Profile Settings**: Users can customize their profiles, update personal information, and adjust trading preferences.

7. **Admin Dashboard**: Administrators have access to an admin dashboard to oversee all trading activities, manage user accounts, monitor performance, and enforce platform policies.

## Additional Features

- **Blockchain Integration**: Withdrawals and deposits are securely processed through a real blockchain system to ensure transparency and reliability.
